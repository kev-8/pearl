The suspect, Mario Antonio Palacios, 43, was detained during a stopover of a flight on which he was being deported from Jamaica to Colombia, the sources said.

Haitian authorities have accused Palacios of forming part of a mercenary group that assassinated Moise in July in an assault on his residence, during which his wife was also wounded.

Palacios was detained during a stopover in Panama and asked to ""voluntarily"" board a flight to the United States, a Colombian immigration source said.

In case he resisted, Panamanian officials said they would enforce an Interpol red notice issued by the United States, which is in addition to one that Haiti had already issued, the source said.

Haiti has also issued an Interpol red notice for Palacios.

It was not clear if he had gone to the United States.

Panama authorities have issued no public comment on the affair but a person familiar with the matter in Panama confirmed that Palacios had been detained.

A video shared with Reuters by the source, who declined to be identified, showed two immigration agents escorting a man, whose face was not shown, through what appeared to be Panama's airport.

Colombian television channel Noticias RNC also reported the detention.

A lawyer for Palacios had no immediate comment. Interpol did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Christian Leuprecht is Class of 1965 Professor in Leadership at the Royal Military College, cross-appointed to Queen’s University and senior fellow at the Macdonald Laurier Institute.

Two years ago, few could have imagined that the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) would end up managing a global supply chain for national vaccine distribution and backstopping the provincial mismanagement of 54 long-term care homes. The pandemic also showed that no one in government fully understands national supply chains across Canada. Still, no part of the country ran out of personal protective equipment even when supply was critically short, because CAF logisticians had the managerial savvy to locate it, CAF planners executed without having to rely on other partners or equipment, and the Royal Canadian Air Force transported it where it needed to go.

Time and again, the Department of National Defence has been called on as the only federal organization with the highly trained, well-educated and experienced roster of specialists and assets to plan and execute complex and large-scale operations in short order. Under Operation Laser, the CAF had a COVID-19 plan that it was able to execute while coming to the assistance of other government departments. Major-General Dany Fortin’s cross-appointment as the Public Health Agency of Canada’s VP Operations and Logistics speaks volumes to the government’s confidence in the CAF to deliver on the vaccinations that are now a top priority for Canadians.

The Canadian defence policy document “Strong, Secure, Engaged” has technically and effectively enshrined concurrent foreign and domestic operations. So why has no part of the Forces been designated exclusively for domestic operations?

In 2006, then-chief of the defence staff Rick Hillier re-organized the CAF into Canadian Expeditionary Forces Command and Canada Command. Once the Olympics and G7 had passed, in the pursuit of staffing economies to support the Afghanistan mission, both commands were collapsed into the Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC). As the only force employment headquarters across the CAF, CJOC manages everything from UN observers in North Korea to floods in Manitoba. The pandemic experience is a prompt to reprise retired general Hillier’s vision for the CAF in the 21st century.

Over the past decade, Canada has become more reliant on the CAF to respond to domestic emergencies: the number of CAF’s domestic taskings has doubled and tripled over the two previous decades. These operations have proven well within the capabilities of the CAF. But in the event of floods, forest fires, or a grave international crisis, CAF assets currently dedicated to the pandemic may have been unavailable. Climate change is bound to multiply the frequency of crises such as wildfires and floods in the coming years, and that will increase demand for CAF resources. The pandemic is a harbinger of future CAF domestic operations that are more frequent and complex, longer and larger without the ability to rely on help from allies. Although the CAF has been able to deliver, after 15 years of efforts focused on counterinsurgency and building partner capacity, Canada’s military still has much to learn and re-learn about large-scale operations.

For decades, the CAF has prioritized a strategic culture premised on Army expeditionary operations despite the fact that Afghanistan represented the only such mission in the past 60 years. Since the late 1950s, CAF leaders have vehemently resisted anything seen as diluting the combat role: they argue that it is easier to “scale down” from combat than to “scale up” from domestic operations. But that is a false dichotomy, and politicians are looking for a broader contribution to national security from their annual defence investment of $22-billion.

This is an opportunity for the CAF to reflect on its operational logic. Is the current command and control construct sufficient? On the one hand, Operation Laser headquarters were built for overseas operations, not domestic ones. On the other hand, the mission apportioned 24,000 troops, about 14 times the CAF’s total allocation to its domestic Immediate Response Units.

Evidently, domestic operations are no longer a part-time sideshow, yet the CAF still responds to emergencies with pick-up teams. CJOC needs a dedicated Joint Task Force (JTF) for domestic operations, composed of regular and reserve forces. The newly appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, Vice-Admiral Art McDonald, is experienced at conducting domestic operations: he was the commander of JTF Pacific from 2016 to 2018 and ran humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations as maritime component commander of JTF Haiti in 2010. That background should come in handy as the CAF ponders how to optimize its force structure in response to growing domestic, continental and international demands on its limited assets.

Martine St-Victor: Adieu to a dear friend who had no match Olivier Royant, managing director of Paris Match, loved Montreal. His death on Dec. 31 closed off a terrible year made worse by his passing. Photo by John Mahoney / Montreal Gazette

Article content The news came on the last day of a year so many of us want to forget. It was for me as if all the bad news of 2020 had been condensed into one terrible text message and headline. On Dec. 31, Olivier Royant passed away from cancer in Paris. The City of Lights had lost one of its brightest.

Article content In 2006, Olivier — a perfect gentleman often in perfectly fitted Yves Saint-Laurent — became managing director of the famed weekly magazine Paris Match, and for almost that long, we were the closest of friends. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Martine St-Victor: Adieu to a dear friend who had no match Back to video Olivier was a rare breed: a news boss who actually loved and understood the media. We met when he came to Montreal on a promotional tour along with other Paris Match executives. I became the magazine’s PR person in Canada. Surreal, really, as I had grown up reading and loving this French Institution, spotting a first copy at my grandparents’ house while vacationing in Haiti. It was the summer Charles and Diana had wed, and the couple made it onto the cover. Seven decades after the magazine was founded, landing on its front page remains an honour for any personality.

Article content Before Justin Trudeau won the 2015 election, Olivier requested an interview with the prime minister to be. He sensed history was about to be made and wanted to continue the magazine’s relationship with the most recognizable name in Canadian politics — a relationship that began when Justin’s father was first elected PM. For over four years and despite numerous requests, Justin Trudeau’s team never granted Paris Match an interview, which Olivier wanted to conduct himself. He was, after all, first and foremost a journalist. He started at the magazine as a staff reporter in 1985 and bookended his career by interviewing Barack Obama last October. In the 35 years in between, Olivier sat down with rock stars and royalty, Nobel Peace Prize winners and heads of states, including two who would attend his funeral — President Emmanuel Macron and former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Just before his death, the French government named Olivier a Knight of the Legion of Honour, the country’s highest order of merit.

Article content I couldn’t believe Trudeau’s team wouldn’t rush to make an interview happen with one of the most prestigious and widely read magazines in the world and one that is a vector for the Francophonie. But that was my ego taking over. Olivier would never let his stop him from getting the story for his readers. And he did. Without the benefit of a sit-down, he still managed to put Trudeau on the cover — twice. Olivier was on the old continent and I was on the new, and we were one generation removed. It is perhaps because our friendship seemed so unlikely that we cherished it so much. It was sustained by a common love for Springsteen, Leonard Cohen, the Kennedys, John Lewis and rosé. That we were Americanophiles amplified our commonality. We had both spent years living in the United States — he during the Clinton administration, as Paris Match’s U.S. correspondent, and I, just out of school, during the tenure of George W. Bush.

We had lunch at the end of 2019 at Le Club 13 in Paris and Olivier had the final words as we parted. “Je reviendrai à Montréal,” he said, referencing Robert Charlebois’s classic homage to the city. It was the last time we saw each other.

Article content Olivier loved our metropolis and had come to know it well. He twice participated in the C2 Montréal conference. And though his schedule while in town didn’t leave much time for pleasure, he could always turn the mundane into the memorable and he never missed a chance to marvel at Montreal’s unique character. The city was rarely as beautiful as when I was showing it off to him. I ache knowing I’ll never get to do it again.

7,965614898,20210114,043,043,04,1,-3.18664643399089,2.8,5,https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/many-covid-infected-passengers-aboard-three-haiti-to-montreal-flights-federal-data-shows-1.5276880,"MONTREAL -- In the last week and a half, three Air Transat flights from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, landed in Montreal with many COVID-19-infected passengers on board.

While they weren't subject to Canada's new negative-test requirement at the time, Health Canada data still raises questions about whether international travel can be made COVID-safe with or without the tests.

In its published data tracking COVID-19 cases on flights, Health Canada doesn’t include the exact number of infected people on each flight. But enough people tested positive on those three flights from Haiti, upon arriving in Canada, that the federal agency flagged all rows on all the flights as “affected” by the virus.

The three flights are identified by the codes TS663, referring to a flight on January 10, TS665, which flew on January 13, and TS663, on January 17.

Since January 7, the federal government has required everyone flying into Canada to provide proof of a recent negative test for the virus, taken within 72 hours of their scheduled departure time. Without that proof, passengers are prohibited from boarding their flights.

However, Haiti was among the countries temporarily exempted from this rule until Jan. 20 due to a lack of test availability. Instead, passengers from Haiti until Jan. 20 had to get a COVID-19 test at a federal quarantine facility upon arriving in Canada.

Passengers from Haiti “were strongly encouraged to perform a test before their flight but could not be denied boarding if they had not been able to,” said Air Transat spokesperson Marie-Christine Pouliot in an email.

“As of today, this exemption is no longer in effect.”

MANY TRAVELLERS STILL ARRIVING WITH VIRUS, DESPITE TEST RULE

According to Air Transat, since the Jan. 7 testing rule was implemented, 472 passengers have been denied boarding on the company's flights because they did not have the negative COVID-19 result.

But even among flights from countries where the test is required, a significant number have had passengers test positive for the virus after arriving in Canada.

The exposure data published on Health Canada’s website shows that 140 international flights have landed in Canada since Jan. 7 where passengers on a portion of the plane were exposed to COVID-19 due to at least one confirmed case of the virus on board the flight.

A COVID-19 infection takes several days to show up in most people -- after what's known as the incubation period -- so if people are tested very soon after their infection, the test will show up as negative, even if the person becomes contagious very shortly afterwards.

According to the federal website, a row of a plane is considered ""affected"" if it's within three rows behind or in front of a row where a seated person is confirmed to have COVID-19 during a period when they may have been contagious.

It adds that ""all rows"" on the flight may be considered affected ""if multiple cases are confirmed and spread out across the aircraft.""

The growing list of affected flights is raising concern amongst provincial and federal leaders and health officials.

On Tuesday, and again on Thursday, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said he's asking the Trudeau government to ban all international travel departing from Canada that is not essential, including trips to all-inclusive resorts.

He also called on the federal government to enforce the post-travel quarantine requirement more strictly and said the province is willing to take extra measures on its own if Ottawa doesn’t act.

Legault said he's concerned about the risk of international travellers bringing more cases of the COVID-19 variants, which are more transmissible, into Quebec. Right now, health authorities say Quebec has seen no new cases of the variant since the first five cases, which were all within the same family.

In a separate press conference Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged people not to travel for non-essential reasons and asked people who have booked trips to cancel them."
