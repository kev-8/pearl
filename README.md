# pearl
An NLP tool to source, organize, and analyze global news data about Haiti.

In this day and age, most of the news that comes out about Haiti is negative. This consistent stream of negative media skews perception of the country. 
I created this tool to uplift the positive news about Haiti and show the world what a beautiful country it truly is. The name _pearl_ comes from Haiti's nickname: Pearl of the Antilles.


More to come soon!
